This JavaScript code sets up a simple speech recognition system using the Web Speech API. It creates a SpeechRecognition object and defines event handlers for different stages of speech recognition, such as onstart, onresult, and onend. When the "Start Voice Input" button is clicked, it triggers the recognition.start() method to start listening for speech input. The recognized speech is then displayed in the output div.
